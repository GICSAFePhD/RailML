Engineer Menendez: Good morning, Engineer Harris. We arranged this second meeting to hear about the results of using the Railway Network Analyzer (RNA) for designing the signalling system at Belgrano C station. How did RNA perform?

Engineer Harris: The signalling generated by RNA for Belgrano C is almost the same as the signalling installed two years ago by our company. RNA also suggested dividing two long routes, allowing new possibilities for logistics in the future if they were approved. The RNA tool also generated the interlocking table without errors.

Engineer Menendez: That's fantastic news! we're thrilled to hear that RNA delivered accurate results efficiently. Our goal was to create a tool that streamlines the interlocking table generation process without compromising mobility and safety. How was the integration of railML files with RNA?

Engineer Harris: We used the railML file for Belgrano C generated by GICSAFe based on the railway layout we provided. We might invest time in training our signalling engineers prior to defining the station ourselves under railML standards. In that case, we will prioritize the stations we plan to renovate the signalling in order to use RNA as a central support tool.

Engineer Menendez: Thank you for highlighting the importance of integrating RNA within the next design processes. We understand that defining the railway topologies in railML is a time-consuming process but it is compensated by the time you save using RNA to generate the signalling and the interlocking table. The railML file generated by RNA can also be used with other railML-based software for rolling stock and timetable analysis. We appreciate your willingness to undertake this effort.

Engineer Harris: RNA would have been a very useful tool when Belgrano C was being redesigned. We are excited to continue using RNA and working together in future signalling designs.
