# Example_8
## Description
Name: Belgrano C Station

This example is the layout of the real-life railway station Belgrano C, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Analysis principles

The signalling generation process used in this work was designed following signalling principles detailed in [[1]](#references) in the section "I. INTRODUCTION".

## Step by step

The following is the general methodology or "step by step" followed for analysing a railway network with the approach of this work [[1]](#references).

A. Import the railway layout description.

B. Define a graph network to associate the railway elements.

C. Infrastructure analysis

D. Detect CDL zones.

E. Generate signalling.

F. Simplify signalling.

G. Logfile generated by RNA.

H. Comparing interlocking tables.

E. Extra

Each step is explained below.

### A. Import the railway layout description

After having installed the RNA program according to the steps shown in the the section ["Usage"](https://github.com/GICSAFePhD/Layouts#usage), run the Python archive "main_GUI.py". This action produces the program output shown in Figure 1.

![Figure 1](select_example.jpg "Figure 1")

*Figure 1. Select example.*

The necessary information to define the graph network is distributed across several sections of the railML file, specifically inside netElements (nodes) and netRelations (edges) items found in the class Infrastructure/Topology as described in [[1]](#references).

Figure 2 shows the railway network without signalling. The user will need the Design4Rail Horizon Software Suite Track Planner application and import the archive "Example_8.railml" to visualise the railway network used in this example. 

For further information about the Design4Rail Horizon Software Suite and the Track Planner application, please refer to [Official web page of Design4Rail](https://design4rail.com/service/d4rhorizon/#section-downloadHorizon).

For a detailed explanation about importing railML files, go to section [G.1](#g1-obtaining-the-interlocking-table-in-design4rail) of this document. 

![Figure 2](Figure0.png "Figure 2")

*Figure 2. Railway network without signalling.*

### B. Define a graph network to associate the railway elements

This step allows us to evaluate the consistency of the network connections provided in the RailML file, through the determination of the direction, position, and interconnection of each of the nodes of the given railway network.

In [[1]](#references), in the section "II. RAILWAY NETWORK ANALYZER DESIGN" in literal B, we see Algorithm 1, which explains the network analysis process.

The result of this RNA step is show in Console Output 1:

~~~
#################### Starting Railway Network Analyzer ####################

ne27 [600, -300] [1020, 120] >>

~~~

*Console Output 1. Step B railway elements.*

In this example, the Console Output 1 shows that the program can identify the nodes and their directions. Consol Output 1 has, for example, this line: ne3 [2040, 120] [1020, 120] <<, that indicates the name of the netElement (ne3), the position (origin [2040, 120] and end point [1020, 120]) of the net element, and the direction (<<, at left in this case, but in other example it could have been at right: >>). The same analysis stands for: ne23, ne25, ne26 and ne27. It can be noticed that Console Output 1 is consistent with every "netElement" shown in Figure 2.

### C and D. Infrastructure analysis and CDL zones detection

The process of analysing the infrastructure and detecting CDL zones allows identifying the position of each infrastructure element in the network: platforms, curves, level crossings, buffer stops, derailers, lines, operational points, signals, switches, tracks and detection elements (axle counters, rail joints and track circuits).

In section "II. RAILWAY NETWORK ANALYSER DESIGN" literal C of [[1]](#references), it is shown Algorithm 2, which explains the process of analysing the network; and in the same section but in literal D, it is explained the process used to detect CDL zones.

The result of this step is shown in Console Output 2 and Figure 3.

### E. Generate signalling

To obtain an analysis for each network element in the program configurations, select the options you want, as shown in Figure 5.

![Figure 5](config_options.png "Figure 5")

*Figure 5. Configuration options of RNA.*

Below, in subsections E.1, E.2, E.3, and E.4, you will find the sequence of configurations used to analyze, step by step, the railway in this example.

#### E.1. Signals generated due to line borders(L) and buffer stops(T)

The configuration of the RNA GUI application needed for this step of the analysis is shown in Figure 6.

![Figure 6](config_1.png "Figure 6")

*Figure 6. Configuring RNA to obtain signals for line borders(L) and buffer stops(T).*

Signals are enumerated since 00 with a prefix letter to indicate which element generates them. BufferStops and LineBorders signals start with T and L, respectively. In Figure 7, we can visualise the signals generated by applying algorithm 3, explained in [[1]](#references) section "III. SIGNALLING GENERATION".

In red letters, automatically added signals are shown.

The RNA allocates signals close to the line boredrs:

-- Stop: *L01, L02, L03 and L04*

-- Departure: *Nothing*

The RNA allocates signals close to the line borders. RNA does not allocate departure signals assigned close to every buffer stop border, because this network does not have buffer stops.

![Figure 7](Figure1.jpg "Figure 7")

*Figure 7. Signals due to line borders(L) and buffer stops(T).*

#### E.2. Signals generated due to line borders(L),buffer stops(T) and rail joints (J)

The signals for rail joints are named J and have a consecutive number of signals.

The configuration of the RNA GUI application needed for this step of the analysis is shown in Figure 8.

![Figure 8](config_2.png "Figure 8")

*Figure 8. Configuring RNA to obtain signals for line borders(L), buffer stops(T) and rail joints (J).*

The algorithm does not assign signalling at the beginning and the ending of each track because this network does not have rail joints as shown in Figure 9.

![Figure 9](Figure2.jpg "Figure 9")

*Figure 9. Signals due to line borders(L), buffer stops(T) and rail joints (J).*

#### E.3. Signals generated due to line borders(L),buffer stops(T),rail joints (J), platforms(P) and level crossings(X)

The signals for platforms are named P, and signals for level crossings are named X. A consecutive number of signals is assigned for each type of signalling.

The configuration of the RNA GUI application needed for this step of the analysis is shown in Figure 10.

![Figure 10](config_3.png "Figure 10")

*Figure 10. Configuring RNA to obtain signals for line borders(L),buffer stops(T),rail joints (J), platforms(P) and level crossings(X).*

Notice that RNA can be configured to avoid adding duplicate signals when the level crossing and the platform are close together, as discussed in [[1]](#references), and therefore, the signalling between them is unnecessary. However, this configuration is a special parameter in RNA. For furthermore information about this, see section [G.3.1.2.](#g32-minimum-distance-parameter) 

It is necessary to introduce signals before the train reaches the level crossing as explained in Algorithm 5, explained in [[1]](#references) section "III. SIGNALLING GENERATION".

Also, it is necessary to have a departure signal after the platform. This logic is implemented using Algorithm 6, explained in [[1]](#references) section "III. SIGNALLING GENERATION".

RNA allocates the next signals close to each platform and level crossing:

-- Platforms: *P17, P18, P19 and P20*

-- Level crossings: *X05, X06, X07, X08, X09, X10, X11, X12, X13, X14, X15 and X16*

This signals are indicated in red in Figure 11.

![Figure 11](Figure3.jpg "Figure 11")

*Figure 11. Signals due to line borders(L),buffer stops(T),rail joints (J), platforms(P) and level crossings(X).*

#### E.4. Signals generated due to line borders(L),buffer stops(T),rail joints (J), platforms(P),level crossings(X) and switches(S,H,C,B)

The configuration of the RNA GUI application needed for this step of the analysis is shown in Figure 12.

![Figure 12](config_4.png "Figure 12")

*Figure 12. Configuring RNA to obtain signals for line borders(L),buffer stops(T),rail joints (J), platforms(P),level crossings(X) and switches(S,H,C,B).*

The signals for switches are named based on the point they want to protect: S for Starting branch, C for the Continue branch and B for the Detour branch. There are also signals whose name starts with H that are not explicitly protecting the starting branch, the continue branch or the detour branch of a switch. These H signals are explained in [[1]](#references) section "III. SIGNALLING GENERATION" in literal E, where a manoeuvre signal numbered with H is always added plus the corresponding numbering sequence by Algorithm 7. This manoeuvre signal always accompanies the signal of the start branch (S) of the switch, and its function is to protect the railway elements that are after this signal (i.e. elements that are in the detour branch and in the continue branch).

Signals generated for Example 7 are shown in red in Figure 13:

- Sw11: S22, C21 and H23.
- Sw12: S25, C24 and H26.

![Figure 13](Figure4.jpg "Figure 13")

*Figure 13. Signals due to line borders(L),buffer stops(T),rail joints (J), platforms(P),level crossings(X) and switches(S,H,C,B).*

### F. Simplify signalling

The signal simplification process used by RNA relies on two main principles: i) vertical inheritance and ii) horizontal inheritance. Both principles are explained in [[1]](#references) in section "IV. SIGNALLING SIMPLIFICATION".

To simplify signals mark the configuration option "Simplify signals", as shown in Figure 14.

![Figure 14](config_5.png "Figure 14")

*Figure 14. Configuring RNA to simplify signalling.*

After the simplification only the appropriate signals are kept, as shown in Figure 15.

![Figure 15](Figure5.jpg "Figure 15")

*Figure 15. Signalling simplification.*

The simplification process was carried out according to the process described in section IV. SIGNALLING SIMPLIFICATION of [[1]](#references), as follows:

- **Simplification by vertical inheritance**

    Vertical inheritance was applied when the B signals of the Sw11 and Sw12 were moved to the signals H23 y H26, respectively. These signals B, apparently were not created, because of the RNA when analysing the switches, applying Algorithm 8 explained in section IV. SIGNALLING SIMPLIFICATION of [[1]](#references), literal A.  

- **Simplification by horizontal inheritance**

    The simplified signals due to horizontal inheritance are X11, H23, P18, X08, H26, X15, S19, P17 and X10. Signals P20, X11 and H23 were deleted by RNA due these were nearby of signal S22, and have the same direction and orientation. The same situation occurs between signals H26 and X15. In all cases, is applied Algorithm 9 (described in section IV. SIGNALLING SIMPLIFICATION of [[1]](#references)). This algorithm was designed to group nearby objects as one single object, and generating signals according to the leftmost and rightmost railway element in the new single object. 

    Finally, signals deleted due to horizontal inheritance: X08, P18, X10 and P17, the priority of C24, P19 and X05 respectively, were superior as explained in section IV. SIGNALLING SIMPLIFICATION of [[1]](#references), literal B.

### G. Output generated by RNA

Once the signalling is generated, it is necessary to establish the railway routes to create the railway interlocking table. A railway route is the simplest path between two consecutive signals in the same direction, using the same tracks (see [[1]](#references)). RNA generates 4 logfiles as a summary of all the analysis, these files are: 

- Infrastructure.RNA: summary of elements node per node. 
- Safe_points.RNA: absolute coordinates of every point where it is safe to add signals depending on prev/next direction, node per node.
- Signalling: summary of all the signalling generated and their relevant information.
- Routes.RNA: Interlocking table with the information of each route.

Aditionally, RNA generates the object that will be used by the ACG. The logfiles are a summary of the information contained in the object.

### H. Comparing interlocking tables.

The interlocking table generated by the RNA in G.4 for the new signalling (Example_8_B.railml) must be compared with the interlocking table generated by Design4Rail for the original signalling (Example_8.railml).

#### H.1. Original interlocking table

Figure 16 shows the structure of the original example. The signalling and the routes were designed by experts following the RailMl standard.

![Figure 16](8_A.png "Figure 16")

*Figure 16. Original example provided by RailMl*

The original interlocking table can be found in the original railML file in railML/interlocking/assetsForIL/routes. There are a lot of information in those lines, but focusing on the designtor tag only, we can find the data associated to begin/end signals. The signalling and the original interlocking table were designed by experts following the RailMl standard.

#### H.3. Interlocking table comparisson

*Table 3. Comparisson between the original interlocking table (Design4Rail) and the interlocking table generated by RNA*

| Design4Rail  | Signals | netElements | RNA | Signals | netElements |
|  :---:  |  :---:  |  :---:  |  :---:  |  :---:  |  :---:  |
| R_01 | S06 - S16 | ne26-ne26 | R_01 | X06 - C24 | ne26-ne26 
| R_02 | S07 - S05 | ne26-ne26 | R_02 | X07 - L04 | ne26-ne26 
| R_03 | S08 - S10 | ne23-ne23 | R_03 | X09 - S22 | ne23-ne23

| R_12 | S16 - S14 | ne26-ne3 	 R_11 | C24 - X16 | ne26-ne3 

The 12 routes in the original interlocking table (Table 1) have an exact equivalent in the interlocking table generated by RNA (Table 2). It is clear that not safety functionality were ignored by RNA.

Two new routes were added: 

Route 0 that uses signal X05 as an extra stop between the platform Plat01 and the level crossing Lc03.

Route 8 that uses signal P19 as an extra stop between the platform Plat02 and the level crossing Lc07.


### E Extras

#### E.1. One-directional and bidirectional tracks

RNA can consider tracks as one-directional as well as bidirectional. This feature is activated by mismarking the "One direction only" option, as shown in Figure 17.

![Figure 17](config_6.png "Figure 17")

*Figure 17. Produce routes considering bidirectional tracks*

#### E.2. Minimum distance parameter

As explained in literal B of section "IV. SIGNALING SIMPLIFICATION" in [[1]](#references), more than two railway elements can be combined if they are close enough. The threshold distance to determine if this combination must be done is a configuration parameter of RNA, named MIN_DISTANCE (minimum distance). As shown in Algorithms 8, 9, and 10 in [[1]](#references), this parameter is essential to locate, relocate and simplify signals. Because of integrity software reasons, this parameter should be between 300 and 500. For default, this value is 300. Figure 18 shows the parameter configuration in the GUI of RNA. 

![Figure 18](minimum_distance_parameter.png "Figure 18")

*Figure 18. Minimum distance parameter configuration*

#### E.3. Fixed length parameter

The fixed length parameter is necessary to allocate the departure signals, which maintains the trains in the network until the next network approves the movement. These signals allow trains to move outside the network without restrictions only if the track is not long enough (fixed length). RNA could easily be adapted to different criteria and regulations, thanks to this parameter. As shown in Algorithms 3, and 4 in [[1]](#references). Configuration of the fixed length parameter in RNA as shown in Figure 19. Because of integrity software reasons, this parameter should be between 200 and 500. For default, this value is 200. Figure 23 shows the parameter configuration in the GUI of RNA.

#### E.4. Using Design4Rail as a railway visualizer.

Design4Rail has not only a sintax analyzer that is used to check that the .railML file generated by RNA is correct. It also can be used as a visualization tool for both the layout and the interlocking table if you import the correspondig railML file. Design4Rail generates its own interlocking table based on the railML file. This can be done following the next steps:

In Design4Rail software open the archive Example_8_B.railml", generated by RNA for this example, as shown in Figure 20.

![Figure 20](import_rail_aid_1.png "Figure 20")
![Figure 20](import_rail_aid_2.png "Figure 20")

*Figure 20. Import railml file.*

Once the file is opened, it will be possible to view the network and its elements, as in Figure 21.

![Figure 21](import_rail_aid_3.PNG "Figure 21")

*Figure 21. Example 7 network in Design4Rail Track Planner.*

In the menu "View" in Design4Rail Track Planner, select "Routes", as shown in Figure 22.

![Figure 22](import_rail_aid_4.png "Figure 22")

*Figure 22. View Routes*

Then Design4Rail Track Planner will display the interlocking table for this network. It is shown in Figure 23.

### ***Note***
   To carry out this research work, we used the software Rail-AID developed by NEAT, and provided to us on July 2021. However, NEAT no longer supports this software. They upgrade to a new software named Desgin4Rail TrackPlanner application, whose functionalities are essentially the same as Rail-AID. Because of this reason, we recommended in the manuscript and the development of the examples available in this repository, the use of Design4Rail TrackPlanner. Users are notified, that Rail-AID and Design4Rail are not free software; therefore, appropriate licenses should be purchased for use. A trial version is sufficient to open and visualize the layouts of examples 2, 5, 6 y 7. However, to open and visualize examples 1, 3 y 4 a license should be purchased.

   Moreover, it is important to mention that when the RNA exports the railML file the Rail-AID software considers all these signals as a single aspect. This issue was notified by us to NEAT in March 2022, they acknowledged the notification, agreed that there is an error on their software and committed to fix this problem. However, this problem was never solved, and NEAT discontinued Rail-AID software, as explained above. This problem is not solved yet on Design4Rail, either. To get around this issue, the RNA creates N semaphores of one aspect and displays them one after the other, instead of creating one semaphore of N aspects. However, this extra signals are not considered by RNA when routes are generated and, therefore, has no impact in the interlocking table.
