Routes 1 to 3 in the original layout are equivalent to routes 1 and 2 in the new signalling. 

Routes 3 to 4 in the new signalling are equivalent to route 1 in the original signalling but with a stop between the platform and the level crossing and in the opposite direction.

Routes 5 to 6 in the new signalling include a stop between the level crossing and the platform. They can be consider as equivalents to route 3 in the original signalling or to route 2 with an opposite direction.

Route 7 is used to approach carefully the level crossing.
Route 8 is used as a departure signal from the platform to move up to the level crossing
Route 9 is added as a departure signal tot stop before the end of the line. The original layout had no stop signals prior buffer stops.
